# react-social-app
This project was bootstrapped with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)

## Scripts to run

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
